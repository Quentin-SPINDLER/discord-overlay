# Discord Overlay

This overlay host is to provide a desktop overlay for when you're playing games in the browser and still want to see who's talking (such as TTRPGs on FoundryVTT or Roll20).

***Requires Windows and .NET v4.5.2 or greater***

## How to Use

### To start the overlay program

1. ![](.assets\download.png)![](.assets/run.png)
   Extract and run the "Discord Overlay.exe" file.
1. ![](.assets/organize.png)Move the "Discord Overlay Host" window somewhere out of the way (but must stay on screen somewhere, even in the background).
1. ![](.assets/organize2.png)Place and resize the "Discord Overlay" window anywhere you want.

### To link the overlay with Discord

1. Make sure Discord Overlay Host is currently running (see above instructions for downloading and running it).
1. ![](.assets/open-settings.png)
   Open Discord's program settings
1. ![](.assets/enable-overlay.png)
   Go to the "Overlay" settings and make sure "Enable In-game overlay" is turned on.
1. ![](.assets/add-game.png)
   Go to the "Game Activity" settings, and click the "Add it!" blue text.
1. ![](.assets/select-overlay.png)
   Select "Discord Overlay Host" from the dropdown menu
1. ![](.assets/accept.png)
   Click "Add Game"
1. ![](.assets/toggle-game-overlay.png)
   You should now see this big green banner, but make sure click the monitor icon on the right to Toggle ON the overlay for the program.
1. ![](.assets/overlay-is-on.png)
   Once that is turned on, click the settings close button. After a few moments (be patient) the Discord Overlay program should appear in the Discord Overlay Host and Discord Overlay windows simultaneously.
1. JOIN A VOICE CHAT!
1. ![](.assets/overlay-window-visible.png)
   When EITHER window is FOCUSED, you will be able to see the "Discord Overlay" window and resize it as would any normal window.
1. ![](.assets/overlay-window-gone.png)
   But once you UNFOCUS the windows (ie. click on your browser window), the "Discord Overlay" window frame will vanish, and only Discord's overlay content will remain.

The Discord Overlay Host window must always be open and NOT minimized, but you can let it get buried by other windows.

**IMPORTANT!** If you need to interact directly with Discord's overlay (such as if Discord is asking you to do something), you may do so using the "Discord Overlay Host" window, *not* the one that vanishes.
